# PlanningPoker

This app is for team leaders or some person if they want to create questions/session.

The application consists of two parts, administrator and user. The administrator can create a question group, 
where you can ask questions which needs to be set(expiration date, how many should vote). 
The administrator can see the questions and make them visible, invisible or want to delete them.

The user application can join queries if you know the room name and the question ID.
The user may vote only once, if the voting time has not expired, if there is no vote, or if the question is active.
If the vote has expired or everyone has voted, the user can see the result of the vote.

The code is in Java. You can see the read / write firebase and many useful things.
